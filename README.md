# TSV-Benfords-Law
This is a simple CLI that allows for a user to input a tsv file with some numerical data to see if the data set follows Bendford's Law or not.
There are some nuances:
  1.) The data must be a canidate to be Benfordian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)
  2.) The data must be seperated by tabs. There are some protections in place if the file has some formating errors, but for best results please make sure the file is tab seperated
  3.) The statistical test is rather basic, as I am not a statastician. If you know a way to improve this, please let me know!
